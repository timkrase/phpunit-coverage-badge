# phpunit-coverage-badge

![Code Coverage Badge](./badge.svg) 

This action calculates the test coverage using a PHPUnit report and generates an SVG badge from it. Supported report types right now are clover and html. Using the html report is only tested with the html file generated by PHPUnit 9.5.0 and might not work in old or future releases if the layout of the report changes. Therefore it is recommended to use the clover report.

The generated badge can also be pushed to the repository to be displayed in the README (or wherever else you might need it).
An example is the badge above this text block, which shows the current test coverage of this project.

Inspired by [cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator) and [richardregeer/phpunit-coverage-check](https://github.com/richardregeer/phpunit-coverage-check).

The template for the svg badge was created using [Method Draw](http://github.com/duopixel/Method-Draw). The color scheme for the background of the coverage percentage number has been adapted from [cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator](https://github.com/cicirello/jacoco-badge-generator).

# Configuration
This action has no required inputs. It defaults to using a clover report saved in the root directory (clover.xml). 

For the action to be able to parse the clover report and push it to the repository, you need to run the [checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout) before running this action.
Basic configuration for the checkout action works like this:
```
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
```
IMPORTANT: v1.0.0 currently has NO support for a custom checkout path.

You can automatically generate a clover report file with every PHPUnit run by adding the following configuration to your phpunit.xml file:
```xml
<coverage>
    <report>
        <clover outputFile="clover.xml" />
    </report>
</coverage>
<source>
    <include>
        <directory suffix=".php">src</directory>
    </include>
</source>
```

# Recommended configuration

This configuration commits the output badge to branch `image-data`. As a consequence, this avoids the list of issues with the alternate configuration (see below), namely:

- bot commiting to the master branch
- constant need to git pull before you can push your latest changes
- phpunit report and badge inside your repository

```yml
      - name: Make code coverage badge
        uses: timkrase/phpunit-coverage-badge@v1.2.1
        with:
          coverage_badge_path: output/coverage.svg
          push_badge: false

      - name: Git push to image-data branch
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          publish_dir: ./output
          publish_branch: image-data
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          user_name: 'github-actions[bot]'
          user_email: 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'
```

In addition, pushing the badge requires you to update your project settings under `Code and automation` > `Actions` > `General` > `Workflow permissions` to `Read and write permissions`. Please note that a separate action `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` is used to push the result.

# Alternate configuration

Setting the input **push_badge** in your workflow to true will enable the commit and push process and the badge will be pushed into the repository after it's been generated. Please note: The parsed report file will also be committed and pushed if it changes during the workflow.

```yml
      - name: Make code coverage badge
        uses: timkrase/phpunit-coverage-badge@v1.2.1
        with:
          coverage_badge_path: output/coverage.svg
          push_badge: true
```

Please have a look at the inputs for all configuration options in `actions.yml`.

# Troubleshooting

## Commit by action triggers another action run
As reported by [MikeDevresse](https://github.com/MikeDevresse) in [this issue](https://github.com/timkrase/phpunit-coverage-badge/issues/7), it might be possible that the commit by the Github action triggers a subsequent action run. Adding a specific tag to the actions github action and then checking for the existance of this tag can be used as a workaround (example is a slightly modified version of the one given by MikeDevresse in the issue):
```
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[ci]')"
```

# Inputs

Paths are always relative to the root of your repository.
